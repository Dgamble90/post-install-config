Select the "Departments" button in the agents tab. Here we will be able to create a new department. Each Agent is assigned to a specific department depending on their assigned role within the helpdesk. In this case we will be creating the "System Administrators" department, this is where the Supreme Admins will be designated. Other specific settings such as SLAs, managers and other email settings can be set up in the departments tab.

After configuring a new department we will set up a new team. Teams allow you to pull agents from different departments you can have an A team that has top technicians from specific departments. For example you can create a help topic that correlates with a product you produce, and assign it to a team of agents that specialize in that particular product. To set up a team go to Agents->Teams. A Level I support team has been created by default, in this example we will create a Level II Support Team.
